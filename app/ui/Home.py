## Enhanced Snowflake Consumption Tables
The Sundeck native app automatically generates a fully materialized and incrementally
updated set of warehouse and query activity data tables. This allows you to analyze
key `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` tables efficiently. These tables also are enriched to
enhance analysis opportunities. Key tables include:

#### REPORTING.ENRICHED_QUERY_HISTORY
An enriched variation of `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY`. Includes all
columns from that tables as well as per query estimated costs using Sundeck's cost
attribution model and automatically extracted QTag values. Additional details can be
found here.

#### REPORTING.WAREHOUSE_SESSIONS
A sessionized version of `WAREHOUSE_EVENT_HISTORY` focused on warehouse start and
stop events. Each record in this table describes a warehouse from start to suspend.
Additional details can be found here.

#### REPORTING.CLUSTER_SESSIONS
A sessionized version of `WAREHOUSE_EVENT_HISTORY` focused on cluster activity.
Each record in this table describes one cluster start and stop. Clusters are the
individual auto-scaling units within a warehouse. If you are not using autoscaling,
this table will be similar to warehouse sessions above. Additional details can be
found here.

#### REPORTING.WAREHOUSE_DAILY_UTILIZATION and WAREHOUSE_HOURLY_UTILIZATION
Provides daily and hourly versions of per warehouse utilization analyses. Useful to
understand where warehouse efficiency can be improved. Additional details can be found here.

## Snowflake Management Tools

Sundeck includes several entirely native tools for better managing Snowflake. These
can be used entirely from SQL or with the [Sundeck UI](https://sundeck.io/try).
### Monitors
Automatically monitor currently running queries on Snowflake and alert when certain
patterns or behaviors are detected. Alert via Slack or Email. Additionally can be
configured to automatically cancel undesireable query patterns. Additional details can be found [here](https://docs.sundeck.io/concepts/query-monitors/).
### Warehouse Schedules
Set schedules to automatically adapt warehouse settings over time. For example, size
down warehouses on evening and weekends to reduce waste. Additional details can be found [here](https://docs.sundeck.io/concepts/warehouse-management/).
### Labels
Labels allow you to categorize queries based on query shape and consumption. Labels
can facilitate sub-warehouse activity tracking and analysis. Additional details can be found [here](https://docs.sundeck.io/concepts/labels/).
